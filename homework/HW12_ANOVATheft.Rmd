```

## Introduction

This analysis examines the impact of a significant spike in car theft rates in 2023 in Prince George's County, and whether that spike has led to a sustained higher rate of car theft in the county. We'll use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine if theft rates differ significantly between pre-spike (before 2023), spike (2023), and post-spike (2024-present) periods.

## Data Preparation and Exploration

### Loading Libraries and Data

```{r load-libraries}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r load-data}
# Import data
theft_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/car_thefts_month17_25.csv")

# Look at the first few rows
head(theft_data)

# Get a summary of the data
summary(theft_data)
```


### Get the data how we want it and calculate the rates

**Task 1** Replace REPLACE_ME with the variables you need to calculate the theft_rate (2 points)

```{r process-data}
# Calculate theft rate and create time period variable
theft_data <- theft_data |>
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(month),
    year = year(date),
    month_number = month(date),
    theft_rate = (total / population) * 100000,
    time_period = case_when(
      year < 2023 ~ "Pre-spike",
      year == 2023 ~ "Spike year",
      year > 2023 ~ "Post-spike"
    )
  )

# Create summary by time period
period_summary <- theft_data |>
  group_by(time_period) |>
  summarize(
    mean_thefts = mean(total),
    mean_rate = mean(theft_rate),
    median_rate = median(theft_rate),
    sd_rate = sd(theft_rate),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Display the summary
knitr::kable(period_summary, digits = 2,
             caption = "Summary of Car Theft Rates by Time Period")
```

**Task 2** Describe the results of calculating the rates for each period. What do they suggest? (3 points)

The results came out as expected with pre-spike means and medians being lower than spike and post spike coming in the middle of the two.

## Visualizing the Spike Pattern

### Time Series Plot

```{r time-series}
# Time series plot showing the spike pattern
ggplot(theft_data, aes(x = date, y = theft_rate)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2023-01-01"), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2024-01-01"), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  annotate("text", x = as.Date("2023-07-01"), y = max(theft_data$theft_rate) * 0.9, 
           label = "Spike Year", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Car Theft Rates Coming Down From Their Spike Highs",
       x = "Date", y = "Thefts per 100,000 Population") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Task 3** Describe the output of this chart and then give it a better, more active title that provides the lede (3 points)

The chart shows that car theft rates remained stable up until the spike in which there was a huge jump up and that afterwards it has slowly been coming down.


Now let's take a look at average theft rates.

### Yearly Average Theft Rates

```{r yearly-means}
# Calculate yearly means
yearly_means <- theft_data |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rate = mean(theft_rate),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Plot yearly means
ggplot(yearly_means, aes(x = year, y = mean_rate)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = yearly_means |> filter(year == 2023), 
             aes(x = year, y = mean_rate), size = 4, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Average Annual Car Theft Rates",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Thefts per 100,000 Population") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2017:2025)
```

## One-way ANOVA Analysis

### Hypothesis Formulation

For our ANOVA test, we'll compare the mean theft rates between the three time periods. First we need to create our hypotheses.

**Task 4** Fill in the hypotheses (2 points)

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The spike in car thefts did not lead to a sustained increase in car theft rates.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The spike in car thefts did lead to a sustained increase in car theft rates.

### One-way ANOVA Test

```{r anova-test}
# Perform one-way ANOVA on theft rates by time period
period_anova <- aov(theft_rate ~ time_period, data = theft_data)
summary(period_anova)
```

**Task 5** Describe the result: are there real differences in the average rates between the time periods? Is this result significant? (5 points)

There are real differences between the rates. The F value is huge and the p calue is low.

## Compare the differences between specific periods

Run our post-anova Tukey test and examine the results. 

```{r posthoc}
# Tukey's HSD test
tukey_results <- TukeyHSD(period_anova)
print(tukey_results)
```


```{r period-means}
# Visualize time period means with confidence intervals
period_rates <- theft_data |>
  group_by(time_period) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rate = mean(theft_rate),
    se = sd(theft_rate) / sqrt(n()),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    lower_ci = mean_rate - qt(0.975, n() - 1) * se,
    upper_ci = mean_rate + qt(0.975, n() - 1) * se
  )

# Ensure time period is ordered correctly
period_rates$time_period <- factor(period_rates$time_period, 
                                   levels = c("Pre-spike", "Spike year", "Post-spike"))

ggplot(period_rates, aes(x = time_period, y = mean_rate, fill = time_period)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Car Theft Rates by Time Period with 95% Confidence Intervals",
       x = "", y = "Mean Theft Rate per 100,000") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Conclusion

This analysis has examined whether there are significant differences in car theft rates between the pre-spike period (before 2023), the spike year (2023), and the post-spike period (after 2023).

**Task 6** Describe the results of the Tukey's test and chart showing confidence intervals. Is there a significant difference between the three periods? In particular, is the difference between the pre-spike and post-spike periods real and significant? Write a headline and lede reporting these findings, focusing on the pre- and post-spike periods. (5 points)

The Tukey's test shows that there are significant differences between the three groups, with 20 points between pre and post spike, 16 between post and spike, and 36 between pre and spike. The p ccalue is also shown to be 0
